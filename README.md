Abstract
Evaluating algorithms used to assess image and video quality requires performance measures. Traditional performance measures (e.g., LCC, ROCC and RMSE) compare quality predictions of algorithms to subjective mean opinion scores (MOS/DMOS). In this study, we propose a new Subjective Root-Mean-Square Error (SRMSE) performance measure for evaluating the accuracy of algorithms used to assess image and video quality. The SRMSE performance measure takes into account dispersion between observers. The other important new property of the SRMSE performance measure is its measurement scale, which is calibrated to units of the number of average observers. The results of the SRMSE performance measure indicate the extent to which the algorithm can replace the subjective experiment (as the number of observers). Furthermore, we have presented the concept of target values, which define the performance level of the ideal algorithm. We have calculated the target values for all sample sets of the CID2013, CVD2014 and LIVE MDIQ databases.
